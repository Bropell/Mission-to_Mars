# Mission-to_Mars
## Project Overview
This project uses the process of web-scraping via HTML and CSS in order to make a web app 
for Robin to impress NASA. The app is able to scrape information such as images and text from web 
pages using python scripts. The information obtained from the scrape is then displayed using 
Flask and HTML code. This project specifically aims to scrape current Mars data from the web 
to display on Robin's webpage. The challenge builds upon the class module in that full-resolution
Mars hemisphere image URLs and image titles needed to be scraped and added to the web page. 
Once the information was obtained by updating the script in Jupyter, the scraping.py file was 
updated to include the additional parameters. Lastly, the index.html file was altered to reflect the
changes on the physical webpage. Additional Bootstrap components were included for the last 
deliverable in the form of changing the button color and displaying the full resolution images 
as thumbnails. Hemisphere images for the thumbnails are displayed below.
